# EpicAdventure Modder
This is a general purpose mod tool for games made with the Construct 2 game engine. It is currently in the process of being rewritten.
- Understands and correctly interprets most values in a `data.js`/`data.json` file excluding event sheets
- Can import and export data from most Construct 2 games , not just EpicAdventure (todo: needs more testing, tested on 5 ish games so far)
